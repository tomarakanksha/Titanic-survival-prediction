# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project contains the code for the Titanic Survival Prediction. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not, making it a binary classification problem.

## Dataset Info
The dataset contains 11 features and 1 target variable. The features are: PassengerId, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked, and the target variable is Survived.

## Steps Followed
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Data Visualization and Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering (if needed using new features from EDA)
4. Model Building
5. Model Evaluation
6. Save the Submission File

## Model Used
For the model, an ensemble approach was used by combining multiple models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting into a Voting Classifier with hard voting.
